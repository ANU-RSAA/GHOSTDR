The descriptors are inherited from astrodata_Gemini.  Some will need
to be overridden here to match GHOST header keywords and content.

The list of descriptors is already long.  Completely new descriptors should
not be needed, but who knows maybe so.  If such a need arises, please 
discuss the issue with someone at Gemini as there might consequences on 
internal systems.  The heads-up will help.
