The AstroDataTypes defined here represent the nature of the data, eg.
being GHOST, a spectrum, a calibration, etc.  Some generic AstroDataTypes
are already defined in astrodata_Gemini, but there will certainly be a
need to add GHOST-specific types.

The types must be defined from the header keywords only.  The pixels must
not be accessed.
