This file contains a mental picture of things that can be improved along the way.
These are notes from Joao to (mostly) himself, in an attempt to keep track of things that could be improved.

---- polyspect module -------

- Things can be made more efficient with the spectral format by not having the second loop and replacing it with a single line that does the dot product and matrix inversions.
- Additionally, one could just avoid doing the evaluate_poly function only once per frame if the model is a single line.
