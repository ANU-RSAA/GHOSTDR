                   The Gemini Observatory gemini_python package
                                  RELEASE X1.0.1

The X1 release of the gemini_python package, gemini_python-X1.tar.gz, can be 
obtained from the Gemini website, 
	http://www.gemini.edu/sciops/data-and-results/processing-software

The gemini_python  package has several dependencies like numpy, astropy, 
and others. All dependencies of gemini_python and astrodata are provide by
the Ureka package, and users are highly encouraged to install and use this 
very useful package. It is an easy and, perhaps, best way to get everything 
you need and then some. Ureka is available at http://ssb.stsci.edu/ureka/.

WARNING:  The Ureka installation script will not set up IRAF for you. You need to do
that yourself. Here's how::

   $ cd ~
   $ mkdir iraf
   $ cd iraf
   $ mkiraf
   -- creating a new uparm directory
   Terminal types: xgterm,xterm,gterm,vt640,vt100,etc.
   Enter terminal type: xgterm
   A new LOGIN.CL file has been created in the current directory.
   You may wish to review and edit this file to change the defaults.


RECOMMENDED INSTALLATION


It is recommended to install the software in a location other than the 
standard Python location for modules (the default 'site-packages'). This is 
also the only solution if you do not have write permission to the default 
'site-package'. Here is how you install the software somewhere other than the 
default location:

   $ python setup.py install --prefix=/your/favorite/location

'/your/favorite/location' must already exist.  This command will install 
executable scripts in a 'bin' subdirectory, the documentation in a 'share' 
subdirectory, and the modules in a 'lib/python2.7/site-packages' subdirectory.  
The modules being installed are 'astrodata', 'astrodata_FITS', 
'astrodata_Gemini', and 'gempy'.

Because you are not using the default location, you will need to add two 
paths to your environment.  You might want to add the following to your .cshrc 
or .bash_profile, or equivalent shell configuration script.

C shell(csh, tcsh):

   setenv PATH /your/favorite/location/bin:${PATH}
   setenv PYTHONPATH /your/favorite/location/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

Bourne shells (sh, bash, ksh, ...) :

   export PATH=/your/favorite/location/bin:${PATH}
   export PYTHONPATH=/your/favorite/location/lib/python2.7/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

If you added those lines to your shell configuration script, make sure you 
source the file to activate the new setting.

For csh/tcsh:

   $ source ~/.cshrc
   $ rehash

For bash:

   $ source ~/.bash_profile


INSTALL UNDER UREKA

Assuming that you have installed Ureka and that you have write access to the 
Ureka directory, this will install 'astrodata' in the Ureka 'site-packages' 
directory.

WARNING: While easier to install and configure, this will modify your Ureka 
installation.

   $ python setup.py install

This will also add executables to the Ureka bin directory and documentation to 
the Ureka 'share' directory.

With this installation scheme, there is no need to add paths to your 
environment. However, it is a lot more complicated to remove the Gemini software 
in case of problems, or if you just want to clean it out after evaluation.

In tcsh, you will need to run rehash to find the new executables written to 
bin.



TEST THE INSTALLATION

Start up the python interpreter and import astrodata::

   $ python
   >>> import astrodata

Next, return to the command line and test that ``reduce`` is reachable 
and runs. There may be some delay as package modules are byte compiled::

   $ reduce -h

or 

   $ reduce --help

This will print the reduce help to the screen.


DOCUMENTATION

The documentation is still limited. What is available is distributed with the
package; it is not available online. Each manual is available in HTML and as a 
PDF. 

Once you have installed the package, the manuals will be located in the 
share directory under your installation directory. Referring back to the 
installation instructions above, this means /your/favorite/location/share. 

The paths to the manuals are a bit convoluted, sorry about that.
