                   The Gemini Observatory gemini_python package
                                  RELEASE X1.0.1

Version: X1.0.1
Release Date: November 14, 2014

==================================
gemini_python X1.0.1 Release Notes
==================================

This is a patch release to address errors in the installation instructions
and adjust the documentation following feedback from early users.  There
has been no changes to the software.

==============================
gemini_python X1 Release Notes
==============================

gemini_python is collection of Python packages forming the new Gemini data 
processing platform.  This release is an "experimental" release, aimed at
developers or the curious.  The objective is to share with the community
some of the new software that are being developed.

gemini_python contains the RecipeSystem, the automation system often referred
to as the "pipeline".  It also contains AstroData which provides an instrument
agnostic access layer to Multi-Extension FITS (MEF) files, and the AstroData
configuration packages for FITS files and Gemini data.  A small package with
library routines, gempy, completes the contents.

IMPORTANT: gemini_python's RecipeSystem should not be used for science 
           reduction.  The RecipeSystem has not been vetted for science. 
           Therefore it should be used exclusively for quick-look.

Refer to the README for installation instructions and for pointers to various
documents and manuals.

astrodata
=========

The astrodata package contains AstroData and the RecipeSystem.

AstroData has just undergone a massive API clean up.  It is the most stable
feature in gemini_python.  An AstroData Users Manual is available, as well
as an API document (see README).

The RecipeSystem has, so far, been used exclusively for Quality Assessment
in the controlled environment of Gemini Operations.  Nice features like
a Calibration Server for automatic selection of processed calibrations are
not available to the end-users.  It can nevertheless be used for quick-look
reductions.  A demo is available and complete documentation on how to launch
a reduction in the "reduce" Users Manual (see README).  "reduce" is the
interface to the RecipeSystem.

astrodata_FITS
==============

astrodata_FITS is a support package for AstroData.  This package is purely
configuration.  It defines Descriptors that are so general they be associated 
with any FITS file.

astrodata_Gemini
================

astrodata_Gemini is a support package for AstroData and the RecipeSystem.

The configuration subpackage contains definitions for most Gemini instruments
already.  This means that opening almost any Gemini dataset with AstroData
gives access to Descriptors and AstroDataTypes.

The recipes and primitives subpackage contains algorithms to reduce Gemini
dataset.  Currently, only GMOS Imaging data can be processed with the 
RecipeSystem, and only for quick-look purposes, as the algorithms and recipes
have not been vetted for science yet.  You might be able to get quick-look
reduction for NIRI Imaging with on-target dithers, but no promises.

gempy
=====

gempy is a collection of modules and functions in support of the rest of
gemini_python. The organization of the functions and modules is a bit 
unruly and is expected to change in future releases.
